/*
The UI is using a library called PDCurses(Public Domain Curses), and allows for (relativly)easy modification of text and it's layout in a console window.
Basic rundown of PDCurses commands:
    BASICS/INIT/DESTRUCTION
    - PDCurses works mainly by modifying the console/program's memory, then being refreshed by the code to update the screen. It is very important to refresh() the memory, otherwise any
      changes you make to the memory will not show up automaticlly.
    - To initilize PDCurses and load it into memory, we always start it with initsrc() at the beginning of the UI code
    - To destroy PDCurses and remove it from memory, at the end we always end it with endsrc();

    MOVE CURSOR
    -PDCurses allows for the console cursor to be moved around with easy, allowing for easy layout of text and objects instead of using setw() everywhere
    -To move the cursor and add text to that moved cursor, we first call move(y,x), the y being which line to print to and the x being where which coloum to write too. (idk why it uses (y,x) instead of (x,y), thats how it's made i guess)
    -After moving the cursor, we would add printw("[insert whatever string here]"), rinse and repeat for each line/piece of text you want to add

    WINDOWS
    - PDCurses has a functionaliy called 'windows' that allow just that distinct window selected to be modified within.(ie. add borders surrounding the 'window' or pin inputs/text to a window)
    - Skys the limit really, when it comes to windows and how to utilize them, people even made games using this library.

    GETTING INPUT
    - Using the call getch(), the program will wait for any time of input from the keyboard, including support for getting which arrow key you pressed.
    - With getch(), you can assign it to a int varible and go ham with that (ie. int c = getch();)
    - For getting input from a specific window, you can use wgetch([pointer to window obj]). You can also assign it to a varible as well.
